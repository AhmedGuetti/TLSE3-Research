# TLSE3-Research
This is a project on research proposed at the University of Toulouse III, to mimic a scientific conference. The topic we worked on is the optimization of CO (Carbon Optimization) problems using Machine Learning algorithms.

# Process

The writing of the paper was the result of multiple weeks of work and meetings with the professor in charge, making it a very exciting challenge through which we learned how research papers are created.
We had been working with multiple research papers on the theme, annotating them and grasping the ideas proposed by those authors. We then presented these ideas to the professor in charge and leveraged our knowledge to find the optimal route in the research. Writing the paper was not an easy task, as we had to reread most of the articles to extract the important points we had annotated, making use of all the resources at hand and comparing them to get a fair overview of the subject.

# Key Observations

- Conducted extensive literature review on CO optimization
- Collaborated closely with faculty advisor
- Developed deep understanding of research paper creation process
- Analyzed and synthesized multiple research sources
- Explored machine learning approaches to carbon optimization problems
